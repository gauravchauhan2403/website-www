# Website

Welcome to Real Dev Squad

Code deployed on: https://realdevsquad.netlify.app/, then served to our domain

## CSS Structure    
### Global CSS  
   - `main.css`
      - This css file will contain common css pertaining to all pages that can be used throughout the website.   
      - For example, a class with name success, when used anywhere throughout the website will make the color of the text green.  
### Page specific CSS 
   - For example, events page css goes inside `events.css`.
   - Also, in future if we add new components, we will keep component specific css like `navbar.css`, `footer.css`, `header.css` etc. 
   - For mobile responsive css, we can have a folder with multiple css files catering to different css pertaining to different resolutions.
